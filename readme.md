# nbx

Execute package binaries.

* `yarn <command>` is a mess because it's trying to resolve a target from 3 (three) different places: yarn internal commands, npm scripts and `./node_modules/.bin/`
* `npx <command>` is doing too much, like checking in `$PATH` or autoinstalling a package if it's not found
* shell aliases are nice but not installable/shareable (?)
* `./node_modules/.bin/<command>` every time is just too verbose

## Install

```sh
$ yarn global add nbx
# or
$ npm install --global nbx
```

## Usage

```sh
$ nbx
One of the following binary names is required:
# â€¦
```

```sh
$ nbx webpack --help
```

## Windows?

It probably just works if you are using that native "Linux in Windows" thing, `nbx` is just an extremely primitive Bourne Shell (or whatever compatible `/bin/sh` is) script.
